 EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING 

We have all been the recipient of spam emails before.  Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messges, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this project, we will use Python to build an email spam detector.  Then use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.  Lets get started!
